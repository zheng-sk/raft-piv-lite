# raft-piv-lite

This package was built on the RAFT-PIV network published with the paper by Lagemann et al. (2021) Nature Machine Intelligence. The original code is available at https://codeocean.com/capsule/7226151/tree/v1

The current version, i.e. raft-piv-lite, was modified to take a pair or sequence of piv images of arbitary size, and output the pixel-wise velocity field.
